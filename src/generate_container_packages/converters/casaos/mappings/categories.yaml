# CasaOS to HaLOS Category Mappings
#
# This file maps CasaOS category names to HaLOS/Debian package categories.
# CasaOS uses human-friendly category names while Debian uses standardized
# section names. This mapping ensures converted apps are properly classified.

# Format:

# Default category for unmapped CasaOS categories
# Used when a CasaOS category doesn't have an explicit mapping
default: misc

# Notes:
# - The "misc" section is used for applications that don't fit standard categories
# - Some CasaOS categories map to the same Debian section (e.g., Entertainment and Media → video)
# - Marine-specific apps should be manually reviewed and may need custom handling
# - When adding new mappings, ensure the Debian section exists in schemas/metadata.py
